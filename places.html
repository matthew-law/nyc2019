        How do the places influence the narratives?
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Each of the sites tells their visitors different narratives about immigration and immigrants. Many of these narratives are influenced to a large extent by <i>where</i> they’re being told: the location of the site and its broader history.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="main">
      <p>
        Immigration narratives are not aspatial, and are frequently linked to specific locations. Pierre Nora described these as ‘lieux de mémoire’, or ‘sites of memory’, and defined these as “<span class="popup" onclick="myFunction('nora1996')">any significant entity, whether material or non-material in nature, which by dint of human will or the work of time has become a symbolic element of the memorial heritage of any community<span class="popuptext" id="nora1996"><a href="bibliography.html#nora1996">Nora, 1996, page xvii</a></span></span>”.
        <br><br>
        The sites vary in the extent to which the attraction is more the curated content, for example the exhibits on the lives immigrants led before and after immigrating on Ellis Island; or the building/location itself, for example the Eldridge Street Synagogue. At the Synagogue, visitor experience is primarily focused on the experience of being in the building in person: the informational displays (located <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction('bethmidrash')">in the basement<span class="popuptext" id="bethmidrash">Technically, in the downstairs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_midrash">beth midrash</a>.</span></span>) seemed an addendum to the main sanctuary upstairs.
        <br><br>
        The precise narratives told at the Tenement Museum are specific to the buildings themselves: the stories told are those of the actual people who previously lived in the tenements.
        <br><br>
        The use influence of place can go beyond simple historical recreations of a certain site. Brian Tolle’s Irish Hunger Memorial draws much of its visual potency from the fact that it is “<span class="popup" onclick="myFunction('pletnevaveller2012')">an Irish landscape that has been removed from its native surroundings and inserted into the urban environment of Lower Manhattan<span class="popuptext" id="pletnevaveller2012"><a href="bibliography.html#pletnevaveller2012">Pletneva Veller, 2012 page iii</a></span></span>”:
      </p>
      <div class="notification">
        “The deliberate incongruity of the memorial in downtown Manhattan is designed to signal ‘a combined past and present’, featuring a recognizable scene from today’s rural Ireland, along with its past associations, in a memorial designed also to focus on continuing international hunger.”
        <br>
        <span style="text-align: right;">—	<a href="bibliography.html#kelleher2002">Kelleher, 2002, page 269</a></span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Equally, the influence of place on the scope of the narratives told at the site can be logistical. As discussed earlier, a key reason that Ellis Island is able to go into such detail in its retelling of immigrant narratives is that most of its visitors will be spending several hours at the site, compared to the average visitor to Castle Clinton who may only be there for a few minutes and therefore the amount of information they will take away from the site will be much less.
